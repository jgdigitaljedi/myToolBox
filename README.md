myToolBox
=========

This is an application I wrote while working as a desktop technician and is filled with tools that made my job much easier. Since a lot of the tasks were client specific and specific to their network, I am currently rewriting the applicaiton to work anywhere. Also, the entire application has a whole list of files I've yet to upload. I'm currently working on stripping any of my job specific stuff out of them and I will upload them as I have time.
