myToolBox
=========

This is an application I wrote while working as a desktop technician and is filled with tools that made my job much easier. Since a lot of the tasks were client specific and specific to their network, I am currently rewriting the applicaiton to work anywhere. Also, the entire application has a whole list of files I've yet to commit. I'm currently working on stripping any of my job specific stuff out of them and I will upload them as I have time.

If you want to use this application for yourself, just know that I am still working on making the changes to the code necessary to work outside of my current job. Also, copy the "Phrasekeys" folder to your C:\ (root). This is obviously only designed to run on Windows XP or higher. I have not tested it on Windows 8 yet.
