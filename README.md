myToolBox
=========

This is an application I wrote while working as a desktop technician and is filled with tools that made my job much easier. Since a lot of the tasks were client specific and specific to their network, I am currently rewriting the applicaiton to work anywhere. Also, the entire application has a whole list of files I've yet to commit. I'm currently working on stripping any of my job specific stuff out of them and I will upload them as I have time.

If you want to use this application for yourself just know that I am still working on making the changes to the code necessary to work outside of my current job, but it should have most of the features working at this point. Also, copy the "Phrasekeys" folder and its contents to your C:\ (root). This is obviously only designed to run on Windows XP or higher. I have not tested it on Windows 8 yet.

Toolbox.hta is the main application, Phrasekeys.hta is just the Phrasekeys section of the main app broken off into a standalone because some of my peers requested it, and AdminRightsTool.hta is a little tool I broke off of the main Toolbox app for manipulating admin rights on remote machines.
